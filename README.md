extract data for ChrX and Chr1 : samtools_meandepth_both_Chr.sh
produce ratio and 1/2 output to indicate M/F
Otherwise, use compare_meandepth.sh, which just states male or female without provididng intermediate steps.

NOTE/ before use, check threshold value for determining male/female.
Note poor samples may show unexpected results. This can be flagged when looking at intermediate steps, also.
